#Website SDK HTTPS Installation
######Jeapie SDK Installation for Chrome websites (desktop + mobile)

**Requirements**

W3C Web Push Notifications are currently only supported by Chrome 42+

* Includes Chrome for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Chrome OS, and Android. Chrome for iOS is not yet supported.

**HTTP and HTTPS**

If some of your pages are served via HTTP instead of HTTPS, then you will need to follow our [HTTP Installation Guide](Website-SDK-HTTP-Installation.md) instead.

If possible, we encourage you to migrate all your pages to HTTPS first, and then continue using this guide.

##1. Download the SDK

**1.1** Download the latest version of Jeapie Chrome Web SDK after the registration of your site in the  [Jeapie Dashboard](https://go.jeapie.com/app/step1-add-site-name).

**1.2** Copy `push-worker.js` and `manifest.json` from `jeapie_sdk_` directory and paste it into the top-level directory (root folder) of your site.

##2. Include Required Files

**2.1** Link `https://cdn.jeapie.com/jeapiejs/webpush.js` and `manifest.json` to each page of your website by adding some code between `<head>` and `</head>` tags.  Most likely, you will have to do it just once in the file, which helps to generate a layout of the site. The resulting HTML should look like this:
```HTML
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jeapie.com/jeapiejs/webpush.js" ></script>
  <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
</head>
```

##3. Initialize Jeapie

**3.1 Init with auto register.** 

Call `Jeapie.init` from a javascript file that is included in every page. Update `0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360` with your Jeapie AppId. Add param `autoRegister` with value `true`.
```javascript
var Jeapie = Jeapie || [];

Jeapie.init({"appId": "0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360", "autoRegister": true});
```
The user will see a window asking for permission to receive notifications from your site immediately after opening the page

**3.2 Init with your custom button.** 

Call `Jeapie.init` from a javascript file that is included in every page. Update `0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360` with your Jeapie AppId. Create or use your button and update `YOUR_CUSTOM_BUTTON_ID` with your button id
```javascript
var Jeapie = Jeapie || [];
Jeapie.init({ "appKey" : "0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360"});

//Replace YOUR_CUSTOM_BUTTON_ID with your button id
document.getElementById("YOUR_CUSTOM_BUTTON_ID").onclick = registerPush;

function registerPush() {
    Jeapie.registerUserForPush(function(success){
        if (!!success) {
            //your custom action
        }
    });
}
```
The user will see a window asking for permission to receive notifications from your site immediately after clicking on the button.

You can create your own logic and call `registerPush()` method.

**3.3 Init with Jeapie Widget.** 

Call `Jeapie.init` from a javascript file that is included in every page. Update `0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360` with your Jeapie AppId. Add param `createButton` with value `true`.
```javascript
var Jeapie = Jeapie || [];
Jeapie.init({ "appKey" : "0e9b2d82456a5ad012714e981d972360", "createButton": true});
```
The interactive button will appear on your site. Click it to open a window in which you will be able to allow sending notifications

**Important**

You must keep all the SDK files together. `https://cdn.jeapie.com/jeapiejs/webpush.js`, `push-worker.js` and `manifest.json` must be placed in the root directory of your site.

Links to `https://cdn.jeapie.com/jeapiejs/webpush.js` and `manifest.json` must be added between `<head>` and `</head>` tags for every page on your website. Linking files this way allows us to be sure that:
- any page can subscribe to notifications
- any page can be opened from a notification (if set)
- changes to the Google Registration id can be updated
- session count can be accurately calculated


**That's It!**

Thatâ€™s it for now - the setup is complete. See our [Web SDK API](Website-SDK-API.md) for more functions.
